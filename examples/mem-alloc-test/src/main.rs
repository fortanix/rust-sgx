/* Test description:
 * This test tries to record the performance numbers with the memory allocator
 * used in EDP. The steps are as follows:
 * Create n threads. Each threads will continuosly allocate a randomly sized
 * buffer, traverse random locations in the buffer and then free it.
 *
 * There are 3 types of threads, small, medium and large. Depending on the type
 * the small threads will allocate and deallocate small sized buffers, and the
 * large threads will allocate and deallocate large sized buffers. The buffer
 * sizes and number of checks are all controlled by some parameters/constants
 * which are there a couple of lines below.
 *
 * The todos before running this test is there in the description of
 * https://fortanix.atlassian.net/browse/RTE-36 (under the heading
 * "Instructions on how to run the test:" )
