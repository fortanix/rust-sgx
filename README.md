# Fortanix Rust Enclave Development Platform

[![Runtime Encryption Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/Slack-%23rust--sgx-blue.svg?logo=slack&logoColor=whitesmoke)](https://fortanix.com/runtime-encryption-slack) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fortanix/rust-sgx.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/fortanix/rust-sgx/builds)

The [Fortanix Rust EDP](https://edp.fortanix.com/) is the preferred way to write Intel SGX enclaves from scratch.

## [Get started now.](https://edp.fortanix.com/docs/installation/guide/)

```sh
# Install EDP components
rustup target add x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx --toolchain nightly
cargo install fortanix-sgx-tools sgxs-tools
echo >> ~/.cargo/config -e '[target.x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx]\nrunner = "ftxsgx-runner-cargo"'

# Check your SGX setup
sgx-detect

# Run your enclave!
cargo new --bin hello-world
cd hello-world
cargo run --target x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx
```

## Note for maintenance

### About creating release and publishing to crates.io

The [Publish Crates](./.github/workflows/publish-crates.yml) workflow can be
triggered or by [creating **new
Release**](https://github.com/fortanix/rust-sgx/releases/new): please ensure the
**tag name** used for the new release following format: `${crate name}_v{version
number}` , although in this workflow only ${crate name} is used, but {version
number} is still required for keeping a good tag name.
