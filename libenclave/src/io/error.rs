/// A specialized [`Result`](../result/enum.Result.html) type for I/O
/// operations.
///
/// This type is broadly used across `std::io` for any operation which may
/// produce an error.
///
/// This typedef is generally used to avoid writing out `io::Error` directly and
/// is otherwise a direct mapping to `Result`.
///
/// While usual Rust style is to import types directly, aliases of `Result`
/// often are not, to make it easier to distinguish between them. `Result` is
/// generally assumed to be `std::result::Result`, and so users of this alias
/// will generally use `io::Result` instead of shadowing the prelude's import
/// of `std::result::Result`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// A convenience function that bubbles an `io::Result` to its caller:
///
/// ```
/// use std::io;
///
/// fn get_string() -> io::Result<String> {
///     let mut buffer = String::new();
///
///     try!(io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer));
///
///     Ok(buffer)
/// }
/// ```

/// associated traits.

/// Errors mostly originate from the underlying OS, but custom instances of
/// `Error` can be created with crafted error messages and a particular value of
/// `ErrorKind`.
