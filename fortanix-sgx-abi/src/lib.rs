//! The Fortanix SGX ABI (compiler target `x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx`) is an
//! interface for Intel SGX enclaves. It is a small yet functional interface
//! suitable for writing larger enclaves. In contrast to other enclave
//! interfaces, this interface is primarly designed for running entire
//! applications in an enclave.
//!
//! The Fortanix SGX ABI specification consists of two parts:
//!
//! 1. The calling convention (see FORTANIX-SGX-ABI.md)
//! 2. The execution environment and [usercalls](struct.Usercalls.html) (this document)
//!
//! Whereas the calling convention describes how information is passed to and
//! from the enclave, this document ascribes meaning to those values.
//!
//! The execution environment and usercalls have been designed with the
//! following goals in mind:
//!
//! 1. *Compatible with most Rust code:* Rust code that doesn't link to other C
//!    libraries and that doesn't use files (see no. 5) should compile out of
//!    the box.
//! 2. *Designed for SGX:* The SGX environment is unique and not compatible
//!    with other application environments out there. The primitives specified
//!    in this document are designed to work well with SGX, not to be similar
//!    to or compatible with primitives known from other environments.
//! 3. *Designed for network services:* The most interesting usecase for SGX is
//!    to run applications remotely in an untrusted environment, e.g. the
//!    cloud. Therefore, there is a primary focus on supporting functionality
//!    needed in those situations.
//! 4. *No filesystem:* Encrypted filesystems are hard. Especially in SGX,
//!    consistency and freshness are big concerns. In this initial version,
//!    there is no filesystem support, which is fine for most network services,
//!    which would want to keep their state with a database service anyway.
//!    Support might be added in the future.
//! 5. *Not POSIX:* The POSIX API is huge and contains many elements that are
//!    not directly supported by the SGX instruction set, such as fork and
//!    mmap. It is explicitly a non-goal of this specification to support all
//!    of POSIX.
//! 6. *Designed to be portable:* Enclaves don't interact directly with the OS,
//!    so there should be no need to recompile an enclave when running it with
//!    a different OS. This specification does not require any particular
//!    primitives or behavior from the OS.
//!
//! Like on regular operating systems, there are two types of enclaves:
//! *executable*-type and *library*-type. The main difference between the two
//! different types is how the enclave may be entered. Once an enclave TCS is
//! entered, the different types act virtually identically. More information on
//! the two different types, TCSs, and enclave entry may be found in the
//! [`entry`](entry/index.html) module.
//!
//! Once an enclave TCS is entered, it may performs *synchronous usercalls* as
//! described in the calling convention. The TCS maintains its execution state
//! between doing a usercall and returning from the usercall. Only when the TCS
//! exits, either through a non-usercall exit or through the
//! [`exit`](struct.Usercalls.html#method.exit) usercall, is the TCS state
//! destroyed. This is depicted in the following diagram.
//!
//! ![Enclave execution lifecycle](https://edp.fortanix.com/img/docs/enclave-execution-lifecycle.png)
//!
//! Enclaves may also perform *asynchronous usercalls*. This is detailed in the
//! [`async`](async/index.html) module. Most usercalls can be submitted either
//! synchronously or asynchronously.

/// enclave thread to submit usercalls to userspace. Userspace will read the
/// calls from this queue and handle them. Another queue is used by userspace
/// to return completed usercalls to the enclave.
///
/// Each call is identified by an enclave-specified `id`. Userspace must
/// provide the same `id` when returning. The enclave must not submit multiple
/// concurrent usercalls with the same `id`, but it may reuse an `id` once the
/// original usercall with that `id` has returned.
