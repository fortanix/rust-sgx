# rs-libc

This is a subset of libc that can be used with Rust inside SGX. Functions are
added on an as-needed basis.

## errno

`errno` is not supported. Functions that have had `errno` functionality removed:

* `strtod`
* `strtof`
* `strtoimax`
* `strtol`
* `strtold`
* `strtoll`
* `strtoul`
* `strtoull`
* `strtoumax`
