# PPID Retrieval Tool

This tool provides functionality to retrieve the **Platform Provisioning ID (PPID)** from the **Provisioning Certification Enclave (PCE)**.

## Overview

The tool is inspired by Intel's **PCKRetrievalTool**, which is used to retrieve platform-specific information from the PCE. However, Intel’s tool only provides an API to get the encrypted PPID with given RSA 3072 public key.
This tool follows similar process but uses it's own RSA key to decrypted the encrypted PPID from the PCE.

## Usage

To use this tool:

1. Ensure your environment is set up to communicate with the PCE.
2. Run the tool with the appropriate permissions and parameters as described below to retrieve and decrypt the PPID.

## Project Modules

### 1. PPID Enclave
The PPID Enclave module contains:
- **RSA Key-Pair Generation**: Creates a pair of RSA keys for the PCE enclave.
- **Encrypted PPID retrieval**: Uses PCE enclave functions to retrieve an encrypted PPID.
- **PPID Decryption**: Uses the RSA keys to decrypt the PPID retrieved from the PCE.

Both functionalities are encapsulated within the PPID enclave to prevent adversaries from accessing the RSA parameters or the private key used for PPID decryption.

### 2. PCE Enclave
This module handles the **encrypted PPID retrieval**. It contains:
- A function to return the PPID in encrypted form.

The compiled C code for this enclave is provided by Intel as a prebuilt `.so` [file](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.25/prebuilt_ae_2.25.tar.gz). To integrate this with our tool, we supply an enclave definition [file](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/blob/7385e10ce1106215d15f874a024ca224c7417eea/psw/ae/pce/pce.edl) (`.edl`) and generate a C wrapper using the **sgx_edger8r** tool.

### 3. Main Program (`main.c`)
- The main program functions as the starting point of the tool, located at the root of the project. The term **starting point** is used here to avoid confusion with the term **entry point** in the context of SGX enclaves.
- It connects the ID and PCE enclaves and prints the decrypted PPID to the console.

## How It Works

The tool’s retrieval process involves the following steps:
1. The PPID enclave generates an RSA key-pair based on controlled parameters.
2. The tool retrieves the encrypted PPID from the PCE enclave.
3. The PPID enclave then decrypts this PPID and outputs it in plaintext form.

## Usage

To use this tool:

1. Set up the environment to allow communication with the PCE.
2. Run the tool with appropriate permissions to retrieve and decrypt the PPID.
