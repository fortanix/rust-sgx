Usage:
    1. Parse stack trace from stored output:
           stack-trace-resolve [-o <opt>] [-s] -e <executable_path> -f <stack_trace_file>
    2. Parse stack trace from output of an enclave over pipe:
           <output_stream> | stack-trace-resolve [-o <opt>] [-s] -e <executable_path>
    3. Paste stack trace prints from an output in raw mode.
           stack-trace-resolve [-o <opt>] [-s] -e <executable_path> -r
Note:
    1. -o <opt>:
       This option lets user customize the output format of the stack trace translation.
       Here, opt indicates options passed to addr2line, default being [default: -Cfp].
       Please refer to manpage of addr2line for further details about options.
    2. -s:
       This option suppresses the output that does not pertain to stack trace.
       Without -s, lines of output before and after the stack trace would be echoed on the screen.
    3. -r:
       This option lets user run the script in raw mode and parses only stack trace prints.
       Without -r option, only stack trace lines continuously following "stack backtrace:" are parsed.
       User could start this script with -r option and copy-paste actual stack trace in stdin, until,
       the script detects EOF (ctrl-d).
       Alternatively, in raw mode, a file with a list of only stack trace prints (one on each line)
       could be provided as an input with the -f option.
